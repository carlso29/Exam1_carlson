Questions 1-5

1. Ecological modeling relates to the use of mathematical models to simulate and analyze biological processes. 
This is not a research area in bioinformatics; however, it is a subset of computational biology. The reason it is 
not an area of bioinformatics is because bioinformatics directly relates to macromolecule information (DNA, RNA, protein),
whereas ecological modeling likely looks at model parameters (i.e. influent mass loadings, cell density, thermodynamics, etc). 
Ecological modeling of populations of organisms likely uses bioinformatic techniques for information
pertinent to the research question, but it is most likely a research area of computational biology and not bioinformatics.

2. False. Not all sequence data is peer reviewed when initially submitted. 

3. A value that close to 0 (i.e. less than 1x10^-50) means that there is an extremely high confidence the database result is 
homologus

4. PCR amplification, Cloning

5. Eukaryotes have 2-3 genomes per cell. Prokaryotes have circular DNA, or 1 genome per cell.
