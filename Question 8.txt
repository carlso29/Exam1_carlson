1. https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/metapopulation-research-centre/glanville-fritillary-butterfly-genome-project

2. LiSs (Linkage map Superscaffolder) for superscaffolding. This software is unpublished

3. Lep-MAP software for SNP data, MIP scaffolder for genome scaffolding, Coral and HybridSHREC for read error correction, 
   PANNZER for annotation, SANS for predicting orthology

4. No, the information on software is only available on their website. The main pieces of helpful information on NCBI are
the summary of assembly level, and the publication citation. 

5. Microarray dependent SNPs are those where probes are prepared on a chip, which individually binds to SNP alleles. The 
alternative is using RNA-Seq techniques (shotgun sequencing). This will give you many reads that you can compare with the
original sequences from a database, but are not microarray dependent. From there, the reads are called de novo. With these 
sequences available, you can use the bcftools function on UNIX to identify the SNP by indexing to the de novo reads back to
the microarray reads.
